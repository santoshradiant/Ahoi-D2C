# CurrentJob Implementation - Start to Complete Flow

This document describes the implementation of the CurrentJob component that handles both job start and completion states in a single screen.

## Overview

The CurrentJob component now dynamically changes its UI based on the job status, allowing users to:
1. Start a job by clicking "Start Job"
2. See the completion interface with payment warning
3. Complete the job by clicking "Complete Job"
4. Upload images (optional)

## Key Features

### 1. Dynamic Button State
- **Not Started**: Shows "Start Job" button with play icon
- **Started**: Shows "Complete Job" button with check circle icon
- Same teal color (#0b8494) for both states

### 2. Conditional Warning Box
- Only appears when job is started
- Yellow warning box with payment collection reminder
- Reminds to collect $95 cash payment before completion
- Colors: background #fefce8, border #995d00, text #a65f00

### 3. Dynamic Status Badge
- Shows "Not Started" initially
- Changes to "Started" after clicking start job button
- Dark background (#1f232c) with white text

### 4. Dynamic Price Display
- Shows "$120" when not started
- Changes to "$95" when started (actual payment amount)

### 5. Conditional Upload Button
- Only appears when job is started
- "Upload Images (Optional)" functionality
- White background with gray border

## State Management

```typescript
const [jobStarted, setJobStarted] = useState(false);

const handleStartJob = () => {
  setJobStarted(true);
};

const handleCompleteJob = () => {
  console.log('Job completed');
  // Add completion logic here
};
```

## UI Changes Based on State

### When Job Not Started:
- "Start Job" button with play icon
- Status: "Not Started"
- Price: "$120"
- No warning box
- No upload button

### When Job Started:
- "Complete Job" button with check circle icon
- Status: "Started"
- Price: "$95"
- Yellow warning box visible
- Upload images button visible

## File Structure

```
screens/
├── CurrentJob.tsx          # Main job screen with dynamic states
components/
├── Icons.tsx              # Shared SVG icons
```

## Styling

### New Styles Added:
- `completeJobButton`: Same as startJobButton for consistency
- `warningBox`: Yellow background with orange border and text
- `warningText`: Orange text for warning message
- `warningBold`: Bold text for price amount
- `uploadButton`: White button with gray border
- `uploadText`: Dark text for upload button
- `uploadOptional`: Gray text for "(Optional)" part

## Icons Used

- `PlayIcon`: For start job button
- `CheckCircleIcon`: For complete job button
- `UploadIcon`: For upload images button
- All other existing icons remain the same

## Responsive Design

- Uses device width for proper button sizing
- Maintains consistent spacing and margins
- Proper SafeAreaView for status bar handling
- Platform-specific fonts (SF Pro on iOS, System on Android)

## Usage Flow

1. User opens CurrentJob screen
2. Sees "Start Job" button and "Not Started" status
3. Clicks "Start Job" button
4. UI updates to show:

## Future Enhancements

4. Add success feedback after completion
5. Persist job state across app sessions
6. Add job completion confirmation dialog
