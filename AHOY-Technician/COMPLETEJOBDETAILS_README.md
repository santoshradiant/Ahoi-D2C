# CompleteJobDetails Modal Implementation

## Overview
The CompleteJobDetails component is a modal screen that allows technicians to complete a job by providing completion notes, taking photos, capturing customer signatures, and confirming cash collection.

## Features
- **Completion Notes**: Text area for technician to add job completion notes
- **Photo Capture**: Required photo upload for job completion verification
- **Customer Signature**: Required signature capture for service confirmation
- **Additional Costs**: Input field with increment/decrement buttons for extra charges
- **Cash Collection Confirmation**: Checkbox to confirm cash payment collection
- **Form Validation**: Ensures all required fields are completed before submission

## Components Structure
```
CompleteJobDetails/
├── Modal Container with drag handle
├── Scrollable Content
│   ├── Header (Title + Subtitle)
│   ├── Completion Notes Section
│   ├── Photo Upload Section
│   ├── Customer Signature Section
│   ├── Additional Cost Section
│   ├── Cash Collection Checkbox
│   └── Action Buttons (Cancel/Complete)
```

## Integration
The modal is integrated into the CurrentJob screen and opens when the user clicks "Complete Job" after starting a job.

## Styling
- Matches Figma design exactly with proper colors, fonts, and spacing
- Responsive design for both iOS and Android
- Uses React Native's built-in components for maximum compatibility
- Custom icons created as inline components

## Usage
```tsx
<CompleteJobDetails
  visible={showModal}
  onClose={() => setShowModal(false)}
  onComplete={(data) => handleJobCompletion(data)}
/>
```

## Data Structure
The component returns completion data with the following structure:
```typescript
interface CompletionData {
  notes: string;
  photo: string | null;
  signature: string | null;
  additionalCost: number;
  cashCollected: boolean;
}
```

## Future Enhancements
- Integrate with actual camera API for photo capture
- Implement signature pad for real signature capture
- Add image preview functionality
- Connect to backend API for data submission
